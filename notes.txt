NUTSHELL
Future plans: 
- Events -- could add functionality to have personal calender and community bulletin from which you 
could add events to your calendar made by friends (or invite people to your events)

- Messages -- private messaging is already in the stretch goals

- Layout and Navigation -- dashboard for now. Splash page and dynamic nav later

------------------------------------------------------------------

THE PLAN
- Screen Share to: build API, basic HTML layout, add modal for forms, generic CSS, determine login feature
- Patti - articles: build articlesDataProvider, article.js, articleForm, articleList
	- delete based on userID and articleID (can only delete articles that you post)
- Matt - chat messages: build messagesDataProvider, message.js, messageInput, messageList 
	focus on functionality that updates in realtime
- Mandy - task list: build taskDataProvider, task.js, taskForm, taskList
- David - events: building the eventDataProvider, event.js, eventList, eventForm

Meet up to discuss which stretch goals we'd like to implement
